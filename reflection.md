### HTML

Enter your reflections on this section here.

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
   videos or the solutions for help?

For the HTML portion of the lab I was able to complete the exercieses primarily on my own, with little help of the code samples, mainly for the form assignment.

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
   exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found these exercises to be pretty helpful in terms of how to got me to use HTML in a basic sense. The form exercies was the most useful as it had multiple elements to it.

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I personally would've liked a deeper dive into the elements and attributes for them as I feel like we brushed through some of it too quickly. There also wasn't many examples to go off of in the slides which made it a bit more difficult to find potential answers without using the solutions.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s
   topic a little better?

I would've liked an exercies that encompasses everything from the former exercies. This could help drill some concepts in a bit more and show how everything works with each other.

### Accessibility

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
   videos or the solutions for help?

I was able to completet the exercise on my own as it was similar to the previous week's form exercise.

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
   exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found the exercise mildly helpful. It does help you look and understand the accessibility programs a little more and what they are looking for
when auditing.

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I would've liked a little more detail on the performance and other options that the Lighthouse program has. I also would've like some more detail
on why these are errors to the program.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s
   topic a little better?

I personally would've liked more exercieses that had a variety of errors. This one only really had label errors, but some more things similar
to the homework 1 would've been nice.

### CSS

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
   videos or the solutions for help?

I was able to complete the exercises primarily on my own with a little bit of help from the videos. Most of the video watching I did
was for media queries.

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
   exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found the exercises very helpful. I think the layout.css was very useful as it was able to clearly show the differences between
types.

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I personally wished that specificity was done in a bit more detail. I understand the concept, but I would've liked some
more problems on it. Perhaps visually seeing the differences.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s
   topic a little better?

In general, just more exercises that utilize all these tools so we can get more practical use with it.
