1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
   videos or the solutions for help?

For the HTML portion of the lab I was able to complete the exercieses primarily on my own, with little help of the code samples, mainly for the form assignment.

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
   exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found these exercises to be pretty helpful in terms of how to got me to use HTML in a basic sense. The form exercies was the most useful as it had multiple elements to it.

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I personally would've liked a deeper dive into the elements and attributes for them as I feel like we brushed through some of it too quickly. There also wasn't many examples to go off of in the slides which made it a bit more difficult to find potential answers without using the solutions.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s
   topic a little better?

I would've liked an exercies that encompasses everything from the former exercies. This could help drill some concepts in a bit more and show how everything works with each other.
