Enter your reflections on this section here.

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
   videos or the solutions for help?

For the HTML portion of the lab I was able to complete the exercieses primarily on my own, with little help of the code samples, mainly for the form assignment.

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
   exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found these exercises to be pretty helpful in terms of how to got me to use HTML in a basic sense. The form exercies was the most useful as it had multiple elements to it.

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I personally would've liked a deeper dive into the elements and attributes for them as I feel like we brushed through some of it too quickly. There also wasn't many examples to go off of in the slides which made it a bit more difficult to find potential answers without using the solutions.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s
   topic a little better?

I would've liked an exercies that encompasses everything from the former exercies. This could help drill some concepts in a bit more and show how everything works with each other.

when auditing.

I would've liked a little more detail on the performance and other options that the Lighthouse program has. I also would've like some more detail
on why these are errors to the program.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s
   topic a little better?

I personally would've liked more exercieses that had a variety of errors. This one only really had label errors, but some more things similar
to the homework 1 would've been nice.

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the

more problems on it. Perhaps visually seeing the differences.

didn't have any information on them. Other than that it was good.

   topic a little better?

I don't think so, the excerise was very helpful.

### Javascript

Enter your reflections on this section here.

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
   videos or the solutions for help?

I had to use the videos for help especially in the last two exercicses as those ones were far more in depth

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
   exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found that these exercises were helpful as they go through a variety amount of things you'd see in Javascript. I found that the fetch
exercise to be the most helpful to me because of the step by step process of getting the api and utilizing it on the webpage.

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

Functional programming could've been a bit more in depth in general since it is a different way of programming, however,
I understand that functional programming usage varies outside of the classroom and sometimes people just don't use it
at all.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s
   topic a little better?

I would like to see an all encompassing exercise that does work and an api and makes more of a proper page with
the exercises before it. It could be a simple site so we can see how Javascript can be used to make a page based
off of data sets.
